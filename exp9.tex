		\Large\textbf{The Role of Full-Stack Development in Modern Applications}
	\end{center}
	
	\section{Abstract}
	Full-stack development has emerged as a pivotal skill in the software industry, enabling developers to work seamlessly on both front-end and back-end systems. With frameworks like React and Angular dominating the front-end scene \cite{smith2020react}, and technologies like Node.js revolutionizing the back-end \cite{johnson2019node}, the role of full-stack developers has become increasingly crucial.
	
	Recent trends highlight the importance of integrating these technologies to create efficient and scalable web applications \cite{lee2021scalable}. Additionally, the adoption of DevOps practices has further streamlined the collaboration between development and operations teams \cite{brown2018devops}. This synergy is essential for ensuring timely delivery of robust applications in competitive markets \cite{williams2020delivery}.
	
	
	The evolution of full-stack development is tightly linked to advancements in cloud computing and containerization \cite{davis2017cloud}. Tools like Docker and Kubernetes have transformed the way applications are deployed, offering unparalleled scalability and flexibility \cite{white2021docker}. Furthermore, the integration of APIs has enabled developers to create modular and extensible architectures \cite{green2019api}, enhancing interoperability across systems \cite{garcia2022interop}.
	
	Security in full-stack applications remains a critical aspect, with many developers relying on frameworks that offer built-in security features \cite{roberts2023security}. Moreover, the adoption of machine learning techniques to optimize application performance has added another layer of complexity and innovation to full-stack development \cite{miller2020ml}, ensuring that modern applications are not only user-friendly but also intelligent \cite{clark2018ai}.
